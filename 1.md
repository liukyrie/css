## Never Be Alone

### I promise that one day I'll be around

### I'll keep you safe

### I'll keep you  sound  

### right now it's pretty crazy

### and  I do

### n't know  how to stop or slow  it  down

### hey

### I know  there  are  some  things  we  need  to talk about 

### and I can't   stay

### so let me hold you for a litter  longer now

### take a piece of my  heart

### and make it all your own

### so when we are apart

### You'll never be alone

### You'll never be  alone

### You'll never be alone

### when you miss me clone  your eyes

### I may be far but never gone

### when you fall sleep tonight just remember that we lay under the same stars

### and hey

### I know there are some things we need to talk about 

### and I can't stay 

### so let me hold you for a little longer now

### and take a piece of my heart 

### and make it all your own

### so when we are apart

### You'll never be alone
